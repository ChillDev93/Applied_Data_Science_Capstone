# Applied Data Science Capstone

This Repository includes **The Final PDF Report (named "Winning Space Race with Data Science"), as all the Jupyter Notebooks and Python files done in the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** (It also includes HTML files of the Notebooks to visualize them directly in Browser).

This project analyzes the SpaceX Launch Data to understand in **which kind of launches of the Falcon 9 Rocket is more likely that the first stage booster is not going to be recovered**.
