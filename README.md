# Applied Data Science Capstone

This Repository includes **all the Jupyter Notebooks and Python files done in the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** (It also includes HTML files of the Notebooks to visualize them directly in Browser).

This project analyzes the SpaceX Launch Data to understand and predict if the first stage of a mission will land successfully and can be recovered.

The steps done for this project are:
* Data Collection using the SpaceX data Application Programming Interface (API).
* Data Collection by Web Scrapping with BeatifulSoup.
* Data Wrangling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium (To visualize the Launch Sites in interactive maps).
* Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash (For creation of interactive Dashboards).
* Predictive Analysis with Machine Learning.
